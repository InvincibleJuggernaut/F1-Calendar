# F1-Calendar
An attempt to create an optimized F1 calendar to cut down unecessary travelling back and forth between continents during a F1 season. It was successfully solved using Google's OR-Tools.
F1 is the world's most watched and followed motorsports category. A F1 season comprises of almost a dozen and a half races to be held across almost 10 months over different circuits in different countries. The 2020 calendar comprises of 22 races.

Personally, I was bewildered by the solutions I got from this program. They seem too be good to be true !
